This is a Python program that calculates the simple interest on a given principal amount. The user inputs the principal amount as an integer, the interest rate as 
a floating-point number, and the time period as an integer. The simple interest is calculated using the formula: simple_interest = principal * rate * time / 100. 
The result is then rounded down to the nearest integer using the math.floor() function from the math module. Finally, the calculated simple interest is printed 
using the print() function.














import math

principal = int(input())
rate = float(input())
time = int(input())

simple_interest = principal * rate * time / 100

print(math.floor(simple_interest))
