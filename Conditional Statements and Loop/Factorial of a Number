This code defines a function factorial that calculates the factorial of a given integer n. The factorial of a positive integer n is the product of all positive 
integers less than or equal to n.The function first checks if n is negative, in which case it returns the string "Error". If n is 0 or 1, the function returns 1, 
as the factorial of 0 and 1 are both 1. Otherwise, the function returns the result of n * factorial(n-1), effectively calling the function recursively until n 
reaches 0 or 1.Finally, an integer input n is taken and the result of factorial(n) is printed.

def factorial(n):
    if n < 0:
        return "Error"
    elif n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)

n = int(input())
print(factorial(n))
