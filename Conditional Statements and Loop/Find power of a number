This code takes two integer inputs x and y and calculates x^y using the pow function from the math library. The result of pow(x, y) is then passed to the 
floor function from the math library, which returns the largest integer that is less than or equal to power, effectively rounding down the result. The 
final result is then printed.

import math
x, y = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
power = (math.pow(x, y))
print(math.floor(power))
