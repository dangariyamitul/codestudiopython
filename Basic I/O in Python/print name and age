This code is a simple Python program that prompts the user to input their name and age. The input for the name is stored as a string and the input for age is 
first converted to an integer using the int() function and then to a string using the str() function. Finally, the code uses the print() function to display a 
sentence that includes the user's name and age, with the values being inserted into the sentence using the format() method. The sentence displayed by the code 
is "The name of the person is [name] and the age is [age].", where [name] and [age] are the values input by the user.














name = input()
age = int(input())
age1 = str(age)
print("The name of the person is {} and the age is {}.".format(name, age1))
