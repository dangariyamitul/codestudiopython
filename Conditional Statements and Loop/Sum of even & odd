This code takes an integer input n and calculates the sum of its even and odd digits. The input n is first transformed into a string and then each character of 
the string is processed one by one. The last digit of the input is extracted using the modulo operator % with 10. If the extracted digit is even, it is added to 
the sum_of_even, otherwise it is added to the sum_of_odd. The input n is then updated by dividing it by 10 using integer division // and the process repeats until 
n becomes 0. The final sums of even and odd digits are then printed.



#Your code goes her
n = int(input())
sum_of_even = 0
sum_of_odd = 0
while n > 0:
    r = (n%10)
    if r % 2 == 0:
        sum_of_even = sum_of_even + r
    else:
        sum_of_odd = sum_of_odd + r
    n = (n // 10) 
print(sum_of_even,sum_of_odd)
